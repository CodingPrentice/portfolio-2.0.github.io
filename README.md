created my portfolio from scratch. 

I wanted to go a different direction instead of the 'model' that was given to us, i know itll cost me points but its just something i wanted to push.

I wanted the portfolio to be unique to me, that way down the road i could always update and critique anything that may need to be changed.

I started off with a drawn out layout on a piece of paper of where i want my divs and elements.

Thought i add in some hover effects with the nav bar functions.

The projects and about me section i wanted to compartmentalize in a sense to where they weren't so far apart when viewing.

I incorporated flex-box to a degree.

with the styling I was critical about every aspect, so with every element and there child there is some styling.
